🏥 MediCare: AI-Powered Digital Doctor-Patient System
MediTrack is a cloud-based, AI-driven healthcare platform designed to digitize and streamline the doctor-patient experience. It empowers doctors to create and send digital treatment receipts, track real-time appointment queues, and leverage AI for medicine suggestions — while enabling patients to receive instant treatment information on their mobile devices, provide feedback, and discover nearby available doctors.

✨ Key Features

🧠 AI Medicine Suggestions
Doctors are assisted by an AI-powered writing pad that recommends medicines based on symptoms and history.

🧾 Queue Management System
Patients are added to a live treatment queue with updates and alerts about their turn.

🥇 Doctor Ratings & Reviews
Patients can rate and comment on doctors, feeding into a ranking system that promotes top-rated practitioners.

🤝 Senior–Junior Collaboration
Treatment receipts can be shared with senior doctors for review, guidance, or co-signing.

⏳ Receipt Delay Option
Doctors can send treatment sheets immediately or after review, depending on the case.

The system analyzes stored treatment data to identify local outbreaks and sends alerts to patients for awareness.
